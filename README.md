# Reforger-Gungame

Gungame gamemode mod for ArmA Reforger.

Gun Game is a classic shooter game mode where you shoot your way through a series of weapons. Each kill progresses to the next weapon until someone scores a kill with the final weapon, then they are the winner and the game is over.

## How to set up

As this addon is only the gamemode files, there is no map or mission included. You will need to use a separate addon which depends on this one and provides a configured map and mission. An example of this is [https://github.com/rugg0064/Reforger-Gungame-Minimal-Implementation](https://github.com/rugg0064/Reforger-Gungame-Minimal-Implementation).
